# Skripsie
Shane 2023 Final skripsie (code and documentation)

So the structure is divided into 5 parts.

- Documentation
- SAGL_Graded batches are the images taken of the graded batches by SAGL, not processed only went through image registration
- Testing in raspberrypi 
- Testing in windows, (if you already have the images)
- Traing, contains datasets and orginal images of training data and code


-In both of the testing scripts another readme file can be found. The only thing one needs to do is change a few file directories to be the same as your system. If this is done the scripts should work. Also there are text files which contain code to complie some of the java files.

- Open the Run and Script files, they contain the layout of which program runs in which order.

If there are any questions please feel free to give me a call/email :)
